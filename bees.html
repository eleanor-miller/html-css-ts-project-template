    <h2>"Save the Bees!"</h2>
    <p>
      I'm sure you've heard the phrase "Save the Bees" at some point. And well,
      it's true! Bees perform about 80 percent of all pollination worldwide.
      Right now, pesticides, drought, habitat destruction, nutrition deficit,
      air pollution, and global warming are leading causes of why bees are dying
      at alarming rates.

    <h2>Solutions</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Ban the seven most dangerous pesticides</li>
      <li>Protect pollinator health by preserving wild habitat</li>
      <li>Restore ecological agriculture</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Apiary Plans</h2>
    <p>
      I've always loved bees and honey, but have been apprehensive about caring
      for them. As a novice, I read blogs and one mentioned Flow Hive. It is a
      system for harvesting honey with minimal disturbance to the bees.
