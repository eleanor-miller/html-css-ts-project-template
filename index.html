    <h2>What is Homesteading?</h2>
    <p>
      Homesteading is a vernacular term for a lifestyle of self-sufficiency. It
      is characterized by subsistence agriculture and sustainable living
      practices that attempt to reduce the practitioners' ecological footprint.
      Modern homesteaders choose to plant and grow heirloom vegetables and to
      raise heritage livestock. Homesteading is not defined by where someone
      lives, such as the city or the country, but by the lifestyle choices they
      make. Many also aim to conduct their lives in ways that are consistent
      with sustainability, shifting to renewable energy often choosing options
      like solar and wind power.

    <h2>So Why Homestead?</h2>
    <p>
      As someone who grew up as a "city girl" just a couple miles outside of our
      nations' capital, I was very self-sufficient without actually being
      self-sufficient. And by that, I mean I was able to take care of myself at
      a young age like cooking, doing laundry, fixing a flat tire, and taking
      the subway into another state. But until I moved to Florida for school in what to me was quite a rural area, I never truly
      thought about where my food came from or how things were made.</p>
    <p>To be perfectly honest, my interest in
      homesteading stems from 4 things:
      <ul>
        <li>Apartment living (loud neighbors, inability to practice instruments, cost etc.)</li>
        <li>Infatuation with making things (clothes, furniture, food.)</li>
        <li>Reading the Outlander book series and daydreaming about a "simple" life.</li>
        <li>COVID-19 pandemic and supply chain shortages</li>
      </ul>
